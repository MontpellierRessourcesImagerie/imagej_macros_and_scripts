#@ String (value = "<html><h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; Overall Functionning</h2><br><p>This method allows, from a stack of images of neurites containing spots <i>(e.g. sm-FISH marking)</i>, to segment these neurites and count the number of spots in.<br>It is possible to count the number of spots from maximum two different channels, and to determine the number of colocalization between these two types of spots.</p><br><p>The process of image analysis is divided into several parts:</p><br><br><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Stack-focus-MIP:</b><p>This macro finds the best focus of the stack thanks to the <code>Find Focus Slices</code> plugin. <br> Then, it performs a MIP with the previous 3 images and the next 3 images.</p><br><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Check-MIP:</b><p>This macro allows you to check if the previous macro has well done the focus. <br>Otherwise, you can manually choose the best focus to redo a MIP.</p><br><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Deep Learning:</b><p>The model created (11-03-22_unet2D_model) allows to segment the axons and make a binary mask.</p><br><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Check-segmentation:</b><p>This macro opens each mask on the image taken to make this mask. <br>We can thus check that the DL has worked well and remove if necessary the masks and images that have not worked.</p><br><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Spots-in-neurites:</b><p>This macro uses the Comdet pluggin to determine and count the spots present in axons.<br>It can be used with one or two types of spots (determines the number of colocalization if 2 types of spots).</p><br><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Check-spots:</b><p>Macro that allows you to view the spots determined by the previous macro.</p><br></html>", persist = true, visibility = MESSAGE) message
